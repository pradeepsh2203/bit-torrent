# Bit-Torrent Client (Peer to Peer protocol)

I would be trying to built a bit-torrent client from scratch without any tutorial. Using NodeJs, TypeScript.

## To-Do

&#9745; Simple Landing Webpage to upload the torrent file.  
&#9744; Bencoder Parser.
&#9745; InfoHash Working
next task is to remove the clutter and store the peers(port and ip somewhere)

the url for bit torrent client is https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0015.html

I have all sorted till the process of recieving have messages but now how to ensure that we have recieved all the have messages and we can start downloading our pieces.
