# Bit-Torrent Client (Peer to Peer protocol)

This is a BitTorrentClient using NodeJS, Typescript and this has a basic download endpoint which when provided a torrent file start downloading the data from the peers following the Standard Bit Torrent Protocol. It's a vary basic project and thus have a lot of limitation. Currently I am not thinking of improving it but If I get some time I might come back to it. The Current limitations that I know of are:

-   It only supports upd protocol for the tracker.
-   It sends all the block request in one go which I think is the cause my app breaks sometime in the middle
-   It very poorly arcitechtured.
